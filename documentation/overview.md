This document is an HMRC Digital specification of a RESTful Application Program Interface.
The API is being produced initially to support the introduction of the Scottish Rate of
Income Tax and specifically the Pensions Tax Relief at Source (Also known as RAS).
The residency status of an individual HMRC customer is not specific to Pensions Tax
Relief at Source.
The design of the API is intended to be extensible for other customer generic services.
